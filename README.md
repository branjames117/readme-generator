# Professional README Generator

## Description

A command-line application that uses Node.js and inquirer to create professional-grade README.md files for projects based on user inputs. The generated readme is based on the [How to create a Professional README](./readme-guide.md) guide.

## Project Requirements

App must generate a README.md with the project title, and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License (chosen from a list of licenses, with the applicable badge being placed near the top of the file), Contributing, Tests, and Questions (which contains a link to the user's GitHub profile as well as the user's email address).

## Table of Contents

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

Download all source files with the CLI command `git clone`. Then, from within the project's root directory, install all dependences with the command `npm i`.

## Usage

Run the program with the command `node index`. Answer all required prompts. The generated README.md file will be located in the ./dist folder, which can then be placed in your project directory before being uploaded to GitHub.
